== readmeDeploymentInstruction ==============================================
During startup a directory specified by the environment variable `DEPLOY_DIR`
(*/maven* by default) is checked for .war files. If there
are any, they are linked into Jetty's *webapps/* directory for automatic
deployment. This plays nicely with the Docker maven plugin from
https://github.com/rhuss/docker-maven-plugin/ and its 'assembly' mode which
can automatically create Docker data container with Maven artifacts
exposed from a directory */maven*
